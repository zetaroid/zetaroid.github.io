				<p>While I was at AT&T, I noticed a frequent gap in understanding between tech leads and business stakeholders. As a product manager with a strong tech background, I wanted to bridge this gap in my future career. A well-rounded MBA from JHU was the perfect fit for goals to pivot and re-enter the tech industry better prepared to face complex challenges.</p>

				<p>High School really is a magical time where you can be a track and field captain, play saxophone in jazz/concert/pit band, become president of an honor society, get your eagle scout, and still have time for socializing and sleep.</p>
