I am an MBA candidate with a strong technical and business background who will be working at Red Hat as an intern for summer 2022. I have a passion for the integration of business and technology, especially finding ways to innovate functionality.

Previously, I worked at AT&T where I was a product owner as part of the multimillion-dollar effort to redo AT&Tâ€™s billing system. In this role, I was able to fully utilize my previous experience as a software engineering to break down business requirements into technical work with my teams.

My previous education was in both electrical and software engineering. This educational background in tech, combined my with industry experience as a product owner and Java developer, has prepared me well for my future roles in business management in the tech industry.
