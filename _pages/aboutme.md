## Good day! My name is Marcus Oertle.

### Personal Bio
Work is cool and all (feel free to jump below for that one), but let's talk me for second. I was born in Australia but moved to the United States when I was about 5 years old. To [everyone who I have ever told this to]'s dismay, I lost my adorable accent within a year of the move (biggest mistake mum and dad!). 

Today, I am many things. A loving husband. A professional in the tech industry. A gamer. An anime enthusiast. A programmer in my spare time. Someone who manages to sleep 8 hours a night (honestly my crowning achievment). I adore taking coworkers/peers out to lunches to get to know them. I love to be near any source of water (ocean, river, bay, you name it!) and just relax and breath in the air. 


### Professional Bio
I am currently a software engineer at Bell Flight working on C++ embedded programming. I completed my MBA in May 2023 and am now focusing on honing my technical skills before eventually switching to product management later in my career.

Previously, I worked at AT&T where I was a product owner as part of the multimillion-dollar effort to redo AT&Tâ€™s billing system. In this role, I was able to fully utilize my previous experience as a software engineering to break down business requirements into technical work with my teams. Also at AT&T, I was a software engineer developing a software development kit for advertising on DirecTV. 

My undergraduate education was in both electrical and software engineering. This educational background in tech, combined with my industry experience as a product owner and software developer, has prepared me well for my future roles in business management in the tech industry.
