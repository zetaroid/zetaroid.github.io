## Good day! My name is Marcus Oertle.

### Personal Bio
Work is cool and all (feel free to jump below for that one), but let's talk me for second. I was born in Australia but moved to the United States when I was about 5 years old. To [everyone who I have ever told this to]'s dismay, I lost my adorable accent within a year of the move (biggest mistake mum and dad!). 

Today, I am many things. A loving husband. A professional in the tech industry. A gamer. An anime enthusiast. A programmer in my spare time. Someone who manages to sleep 8 hours a night (honestly my crowning achievment). I adore taking coworkers/peers out to lunches to get to know them. I love to be near any source of water (ocean, river, bay, you name it!) and just relax and breath in the air. 


### Professional Bio
I am an MBA candidate with a strong technical and business background who will be working at Red Hat as an intern for summer 2022. I have a passion for the integration of business and technology, especially finding ways to innovate functionality.

Previously, I worked at AT&T where I was a product owner as part of the multimillion-dollar effort to redo AT&Tâ€™s billing system. In this role, I was able to fully utilize my previous experience as a software engineering to break down business requirements into technical work with my teams.

My previous education was in both electrical and software engineering. This educational background in tech, combined my with industry experience as a product owner and Java developer, has prepared me well for my future roles in business management in the tech industry.
