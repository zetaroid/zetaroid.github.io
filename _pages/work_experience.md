					<h3>Red Hat</h3>

					<h3>AT&T</h3>
					<p>Technology Development Program</p>
					<p>2019-2021</p>
				</header>
				<p>My time at AT&T was an incredible learning experience. I was a part of the Technology Development program with AT&T where I did two rotations. In my first rotation, I was a software developer creating the Xandr Advertising Platform for DirecTV. For second rotation, I switched roles to product mangager for AT&T's massive new billing system. I fell in love with the way a product manager can shape the tech they work with and decided to continue on that track for my career.</p>
