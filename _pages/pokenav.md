## FAQ
* What is this bot?
  * This bot is full Pokemon RPG experience on Discord where you play through a full length Pokemon game based on Pokemon Emerald. It includes exploration, battles, gyms, PVP, trading, Battle Tower, and more!
* Does this bot make money in any way?
  * NO! This bot is entirely free to play - no fees and no bribing you for votes. Play as much as you want and have fun!
* How do I save?
  * Game autosaves, you do not need to do anything.
  * By default, you will have one global save. If you want separate save files per server, use `/disable_global_save`.
* I'm confused on where to go.
  * `/guide`.
* How long did this take to make?
  * I have been working on this since February 2021. Core mechanics took around 2 months but I have been updating ever since.
* Is there PVP?
  * Yes! 
  * For PVP against another user on your server, use `/battle @user`
  * When participating in PVP, your Pokemon will temporarily be raised to level 100.
* What is the shiny rate?
  * 1/200, and yes NPC trainers can have shiny Pokemon too (I'm sorry).
  * There are second form of shinies called "distortions" that have 1/10,000 odds.
* Can I catch legendaries?
  * Yes. And you can shiny hunt them.
* Can you catch gen 4-8 Pokemon?
  * You can catch any non-legendary gen 1-8 Pokemon in Altering Cave after you beat the Elite 4. You can alter the Pokemon there with '/set_altering_cave' in exchange for 10 BP (BP is earned at the Battle Tower, from raids, or during events).
* Are there Mega Evolutions/Z-moves/Dynamax?
  * Although the mechanics are not in game, Mega forms and Gigantamax forms can be obtained by purchasing a Mega/Dynamax Stone from the `/shop` with BP the changing form with the `/change_form` command.
* Is there a move relearner/TM's?
  * Lilycove City has both.
* What are the `/game_corner` payouts and odds?
  * See: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mauville_Game_Corner for odds and payouts.
* Can [insert request here] be added?
  * Maybe, maybe not, ask me though!
* Why doesn't [insert move here] work as it does in the main series?
  * I decided not to implement certain moves like Foresight that are rarely ever used. If there is enough demand for some of these moves in the future, I will gladly take the time to add them.
  * Some moves, like Hyper Beam, do not take a turn to recharge but have had their power reduced to compensate.
* Can I get help or get involved?
  * We have a [support server](https://discord.gg/HwYME4Vwj9) you can join to get help / contact the developer. 
  * The support server also has a channel for suggestions for the bot.
  * If you want to help with creating JSON files for other regions, please let me know I could use help!
  * In terms of involvement, we are not particularly looking for development support, but definitely could use some help promoting the bot.
