					<h3>#1 - Xenoblade Chronicles 2</h3>
					<p>Nintendo Switch</p>
				</header>
				<p>While relatively unknown as a game, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 combines stellar storytelling with a world that sucks you in and characters you can never forget. I picked this game up on a whim when it came out because my roommate in college played the first and it has since become my favorite game of all time.</p>

					<h3>#2 - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</h3>
					<p>PC, Xbox, Playstation</p>
				</header>
				<p>The pinnacle of my childhood gaming. Although not as well known as its successor, Skyrim, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion sets itself apart for me with its colorful world and overall humorous tone it takes throughout the game. The world feels the most 'fantasy' out of the Elder Scrolls games to me and I hope that Bethesda brings back some of this feeling in the next entry in the series.</p>

					<h3>#3 - Sea of Thieves</h3>
					<p>PC, Xbox</p>
				</header>
				<p>Sea of Thieves is arguably the most unique game I have ever played and certainly the most hours I have ever put into a video game. The base concept at the game's launch was simple: hop on a boat with up to four friends and sail around on varoius mini quests while watching out for other players who want to steal your loot. Over a few years, the game evolved to have a fully realized story campaign, a full on collaboration with Pirates of the Caribbean, and a crazy amount of new content such as Megalodons, new areas of the sea, underwater mermaids, and so much more.</p>

					<h3>#4 - Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
					<p>PC, Xbox, Playstation</p>
				</header>
				<p>I bought this game on a whim on sale for $20. And much to my surprise it now sits at #4 on my top games of all time. From the presentation, to the old western setting, to the story, to the characters that are so well written they feel alive - Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute masterpiece of a single player RPG. While not perfect, RDR2 captivated me at every turn and never once felt like a slog. My only complaint is I want more, and Red Dead Online definitely doesn't fill that void.</p>

					<h3>#5 - Pokémon Colosseum</h3>
					<p>Gamecube</p>
				</header>
				<p>I am so excited to reach this game on this list. Pokémon Colosseum is lesser known entry in the francise but frankly it is Pokémon at its absolute best. It takes the usual gameplay of turn based battles and turns it up to 11 with every battle being a challenging double battle, the introduction of Shadow Pokémon and catching them from other trainers, as well as arguably the best storyline the francise has seen. Pair all that with the novelty of seeing Pokémon on the big screen in 3D and this game cemented itself as one my all time favorites.</p>

					<h3>#6 - Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h3>
					<p>PC, Xbox, Playstation</p>
				</header>
				<p>Horror games were never my thing. But after countless internet posts raving about how amazing this game was I had to try it out. I may have needed a bit of handholding to get through it, but Resident Evil 7 got my adrenaline pumping at every turn and its story was so intriguing I absolutely had to finish it. The switch to 1st person perspective for RE games was a hot topic amongst long time fans, but as relative newcomer to the series I adored the new take.</p>

					<h3>#7 - Super Mario Sunshine</h3>
					<p>Gamecube, Nintendo Switch</p>
				</header>
				<p>I'm not going to lie, the fact that this is above any other Mario game on this list is 100% nostalgia goggles. That said, Super Mario Sunshine's unique F.L.O.O.D. mechanic and vibrant, colorful world stand out to me to this day. It's not as tightly controlled as most other 3D Mario platformers, but its charm is in spades. Also the way the game's hub-world was able to make the game feel open-world despite being a level based platformer is something I have not seen any other Mario game repeat.</p>

					<h3>#8 - The Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
					<p>Wii U, Switch</p>
				</header>
				<p>Simply put: this game reignited the open world genre. Open world games as a whole had become stale and repetitive with every game feeling like the last with a new coat of paint. Then BOTW comes along and turns the whole notion of how the genre works upside down - and it worked. I've always had a weird relationship with Zelda games where I love the IP but never the biggest fan of the actual gameplay - but BOTW made me fall in love with gaming again.</p>
