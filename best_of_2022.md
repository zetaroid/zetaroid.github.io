					<h3>Pokémon Legends Arceus</h3>
					<p>January 28, 2022</p>
					<p>Nintendo Switch</p>
				</header>
				<p>An incredible switch up to the Pokémon formula, Legends Arceus shines as proof the series has a bright future. While the game has low replayability due to the nature of its "catch 'em all" gameplay, the 60 hours adventure truly feels like the Pokémon game many of us dreamed of as kids. I am hopeful that future main series games learn from what this game did right and manage to mix that into the more traditional formula.</p>

					<h3>Elden Ring</h3>
					<p>February 25, 2022</p>
					<p>PC, Xbox, Playstation</p>
				</header>
				<p>If you've looked at my top games list, you might notice that there is not a single Dark Souls game on that list. Dark Souls is a great series, but I was never able to get into it. However, Elden Ring took the base concept and refined combat mechanics and put it in an open world setting - and, oh boy, it WORKS. It took me around 90 hours to complete this game and there is still so much left unexplored; and unlike many other open world games I never once felt fatigued or bored of the world I was exploring.</p>

					<h3>Genshin Impact</h3>
					<p>September 28, 2020</p>
					<p>PC, Playstation, Mobile</p>
				</header>
				<p>Yes, its a free-to-play mobile game. Yes, it has microtransactions and a gacha system. But Genshin Impact is a testament that those kind of games also can be QUALITY. The world, the characters, the combat, quality and good gameplay design oozes at every corner. While the story isn't first class, it is exciting and will continue to unfold over the next few years. I'm excited to be on this train of adventure and look forward to seeing where it takes me.</p>

					<h3>Nintendo Switch Sports</h3>
					<p>April 29, 2022</p>
					<p>Nintendo Switch</p>
				</header>
				<p>Party like it's 2008. This throwback to the Wii era of Wii Sports is wonderfully nostalgic and equally fresh for 2022. The addition of online play to the beloved formula cannot be understated and adds so much more depth to the classic concept.</p>
